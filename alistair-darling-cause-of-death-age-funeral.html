Despite us representing opposing parties, I always valued his immense contribution and enjoyed working with him too”</p><p>Brian Wilson, a former Labour minister said: “He certainly wasn’t a prima donna, in any sense: he was just a calm, able guy, but always with a good moral and political compass. He was the right man at the right time”</p><p>Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, who worked with Darling at the Treasury as an adviser, called him “a man who always felt the weight of the huge decisions that public service involves, but was still able to take them – even in the darkest of economic times”</p><p>Lord Stewart Wood, who was a Downing Street adviser under Brown, said Darling was a “wise, calm and clever politician, an extremely funny and generous man”.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale, former Labour leader in Scotland, said: “Compelling intellect, wicked sense of humor, phenomenal public servant and the most loving father and husband. Such a great, great loss”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/30164512/The-Late-Alistair-Darling-1024x681.jpg><p>Darling was born in London in 1953 and attended Loretto School in Musselburgh, Scotland.
