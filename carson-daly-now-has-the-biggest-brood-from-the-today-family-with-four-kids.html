In the decades since he was the heartthrob at the front of TRL, Carson has taken on a slew of other gigs, including a co-anchor position at Today. He's also had hosting gigs on The Voice and on the late night show Last Call with Carson Daly (which came to an end in 2019).</p><p>Carson has even shirked his playboy reputation and settled down in recent years as well. He's been married to film producer and food vlogger <a href=#>Siri Pinter</a> since 2015, and the two are the<a href=#> proud parents of four children</a>, including newborn Goldie.&nbsp;</p><p>The Today family has grown exponentially in recent years, as Carson, Dylan Dreyer, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, and Jenna Bush Hager have all added to their own respective families in recent years.

The two were inspired by a DNA test revelation that Carson was almost 100 percent Irish. When looking at Irish names, the pair was struck by "Goldie." They also viewed the baby as the pot of gold at the end of their rainbow, since they have said that she will likely be their last baby.&nbsp;</p><p>"We had a short list of names that we liked, but nothing was sticking its neck out. And I thought about it, you know, this is our fourth kid," Carson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>. "She seems like the pot of gold at the end of our family rainbow."</p><p>Her middle name came from Carson's mother, Patricia Daly Caruso, who passed away in 2017. Goldie was born two days before Patricia's birthday, making the middle name choice all the more meaningful.</p><p>While Goldie's birth was stressful considering the global health pandemic, Carson explained on Today that her arrival has come at the perfect time.</p><p>"She's been a wonderful distraction," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a> when appearing remotely on the show. Siri also explained on the show that Goldie's older siblings are loving the newest addition.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Daly Planet Exclusive!

The Daly family wants to send a special shout out to the incredibly brave & selfless medical staff at our hospital in New York and also the many courageous people on the front lines of this dreadful virus. We thank God not only for the safe birth of our daughter, but for their tireless work attending to so many in need. It is a bittersweet event for us as we are extremely grateful, but also mindful of this unparalleled time in our history. We appreciate your well wishes and ask that you join us in praying for the many suffering around the world.
