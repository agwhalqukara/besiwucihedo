Because he wasn't allowed to wear his own. He has to wear the Chick-fil-A one, that costs $60," Bavid says, after showing a screen capture of a red Chick-fil-A jacket on the screen on his video.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bavid continued, "And it's one thing to make your employees pay for their own uniforms, but to make them pay full price. No employee discount or anything is kind of crazy. $53 for this? Really?" he says, continuing to sound off on the same red jacket.</p><p>"And it's even worse when you find out the average team member pay is $13.89 an hour," he says, showing what appears to be an online resource in the video that aggregates Chick-fil-A employee hourly wages.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"And the most ironic part about this jacket for me is the fact that there's barely any Chick-fil-A branding on it. Like this is straight from their retail store, maybe there's an employee store but I don't see any branding. And you're probably thinking well there's probably something on the back you're not showing."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bavid then highlights another image from the red jacket's product page, which shows off the back of the Chick-fil-A jacket. It's devoid of any branding as the TikToker states: "There's nothing on the back either just that little patch on the side arm. This is just a red coat, right?"</p><p>Bavid went on to say that he scoured Chick-fil-A's product store to discover that there wasn't a heck of a whole lot of items that carried Chick-fil-A branding: "In fact, the only item I found with actual Chick-fil-A branding is the rain poncho. And if that rain poncho isn't your style well you can pick up this rain parka for $70."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But there's another piece of outerwear that looked toastier than the other options: "And if you want to feel extra warm well you can drop half your paycheck on this bad boy." His video transitions to showing a charcoal-colored Okemos Parka that retails for $161.50.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Heaven forbid this manager loses a customer because they drove up to a Chick-fil-A drive-thru and when they got to the window they saw one of the employees wearing a red coat, but it wasn't the Chick-fil-A red coat and they drove away, fast."</p><p>Bavid further highlighted how bizarre he thought the dress code for the chicken sandwich fast food retailer was with a caption for the video, which reads: "I thought they where into God and stuff ..."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Commenters had a litany of different responses to Bavid's commentary of the Chick-fil-A employee's post, which one person stating that this strict adherence to dress protocols must be contingent upon the locations folks work at.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One person wrote that they've been to Chick-fil-A stores where employees have regularly rocked non-CFA gear during their shifts: "This policy must be applied by who owns the store because I see employees at stores in my area wearing regular jackets."</p><p>However there was another person who left a remark that seemed to be more in line with Bavid's criticism of the chain and that they, too, were expected to wear Chick-fil-A branded clothing items while they were on shift.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>What's more is that if employees agree to purchasing these items, the TikToker stated that they aren't expected to pay for them upfront, but that the merchandise is instead deducted from their paycheck: "I used to work at chickfila & it gets deducted out of your paycheck. if you work upfront & put outside you have to wear their jacket or be sent home."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Someone else said that they receive free swag from their own place of employment, which they find strange as they work in a remote capacity: "My company is sending everyone jackets. And itâs office and remote work. Get on board, CFA."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In some parts of the country, it isn't legal at all. In others: if the item features a company's branding on it, then employees can't be charged for it, and in others, companies can certainly charge workers for uniforms, but said worker must still be making minimum wage when the deduction for that item is taken out of their paycheck.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWqr8pmnaKkXZZ6uLvRpJyrq12bvLOvxJ1kraddpcKzr8eaqp5lmpawrLHTrA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./crystal-kung-minkoff-husband-rhobh-wikipedia-biography-age-ethnicity-net-worth-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;Crystal Kung Minkoff Husband, RHOBH, Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Instagram</a>
