One day, she wakes up with horns and a tail and learns that she has to defeat a magical girl to break the curse and restore her clan’s honor. However, the magical girl turns out to be Momo Chiyoda, a kind and friendly girl who attends the same school as Yuko. Instead of fighting, Momo decides to help Yuko train and improve her skills, while also becoming her friend and confidant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ending_Explanation></span><strong>Ending Explanation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The anime is based on a four-panel manga by Izumo Ito, which began serialization in 2014 and is still ongoing. The manga has six volumes so far, and the first season of the anime adapted the first volume. The second season will likely adapt the second and third volumes, which means that it will not cover the entire manga story. Therefore, the anime will not have a definitive ending, but rather a cliffhanger or an open-ended conclusion that leaves room for a possible third season.</p><p>The manga has not reached its final arc yet, so the ultimate fate of Yuko and Momo is still unknown. However, based on the latest chapters, it seems that the manga is heading towards a romantic and dramatic direction, as Yuko and Momo realize their feelings for each other and face some challenges and revelations that will test their relationship and their roles as a demon girl and a magical girl.</p><p><strong>See Also:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zom 100 Episode 11 Release Date</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ratings_and_Reviews></span><strong>Ratings and Reviews</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Demon Girl Next Door is a popular and well-received anime series that has gained a lot of fans and praise for its humor, charm, and cuteness.
