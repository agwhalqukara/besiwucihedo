According to several sources, she worked for him for eight years, during which time they likely developed a close bond. Juana’s job required her to spend a lot of time with Pedro, helping him with his work and personal matters. Over time, they got to know each other well, and their relationship grew beyond a professional one.</p><p>Despite the significant age difference of nearly four decades between them, Pedro and Juana started dating around the time Juana stopped working as his personal assistant. More than a few sources have revealed the fact that they got married in a secret ceremony in 2019 after dating for some time.</p><p>They have been together for over ten years, which means they likely started dating around 2009 or 2010.

It is worth noting that Pedro has four sons and two daughters, including the late artist Jenni Rivera.</p><p>Most of his surviving children are significantly older than Juana.
