We’ll cover their three <a rel=nofollow href=#>most watched YouTube videos</a>, as these have contributed to their popularity on the internet.</p><p>Their #1 video “Onyx Kids – Greedy Granny vs Shasha and Shiloh” has been watched over 46 million times since 20 March 2017, and features two of the Onyx Kids talking about their ‘greedy nanny’ and watching her fall asleep after having eaten tons of cookies.</p><p>The family’s second most popular video “Onyx Kids – Broken Fidget Spinner?

He’s the author of several inspirational books, and has been a marriage and family therapist and ordained minister for over two decades now. Originally from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Mirthell’s today the host of the podcast “Onyx Life”, which aims to inspire families around the world; he also loves to prepare delicious foods for his family.</p><p>Rita’s the CEO of the united Onyx Family brands, and her family refers to her as ‘the mastermind behind it all’. She <a rel=nofollow href=#>was a nurse</a> prior to deciding to leave the job behind and focus on being home with her family, and helping shoot their YouTube videos; Rita’s today the author of several fiction books for both children and adults, while she’s also written inspirational non-fiction books about her and Mirthell’s life together. She’s originally from Los Angeles, California and it’s believed that she and Mirthell met there as he and his family moved to Los Angeles a couple of years after he was born.</p><h2><span id=The_familys_presence_on_the_internet>The family’s presence on the internet</span></h2><p>The Onyx Family are active on various social media networks, but aren’t as popular as on their YouTube channels.</p><p>Their Instagram account is today followed by more than 55,000 people and over 1,600 pictures and videos have been posted onto it, with most featuring them spending time together, whether they’re decorating their Christmas tree, pranking each other or preparing delicious foods.</p><p>The family created their Twitter account in October 2016 and have since posted over 5,600 times; most of their Twitter content serves to promote their YouTube videos, although they also enjoy sharing the details of their everyday lives.</p><p>Their TikTok account numbers more than 700,000 followers and over 6.3 million likes of all their videos together; they mostly upload comedy content, with their videos featuring them pulling pranks on each other, telling jokes and taking on internet challenges.</p><p>The family also has a Facebook page, today followed by nearly 50,000 people, and their most recent update was on 7 December 2023, when they posted a picture of them standing in front of their Christmas tree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunDDx6hkmqqVYsGpsYymnKaalafAbrvFZqansahiuKqw0maroZ2Zp3qis8RmmaKnXay2rLWMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-did-oliver-anthony-cancelled-his-show-at-nashville-who-is-oliver-anthony.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Did Oliver Anthony Cancelled His Show at Nashville?
